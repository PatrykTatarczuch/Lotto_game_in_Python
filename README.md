# Lotto_game_in_Python
- Rules:
    1. You can only write intigers from 1 to 49
    2. You can only write 6 numbers
       
- What if you make mistake?
    1. It is no problem, I created the application to rejects all incorrect values such as:
      - a number less than one
      - a number greater than 49
      - a number that is not an integer
      - repeated numbers
    After each incorrect entry, you get another chance to enter the correct number
    
- Steps to use the code:
    1. Copy my code to the Pycharm environment
    2. Install the "random" package by right-clicking on the word "random", then left-clicking on the "Show Context Actions" sentence, then left-clicking on the           "Install package random" sentence1
    3. You are ready to play
       
- How does the app works?:
    1. Run the code with the green "run" button (make sure you run the right file)
    2.
